# Project Architecture
The following program is a school registration program for students and classes alike. It was refactored from a single class in Main to a modular design to facilitate different elements and make an overall cleaner experience for both users and developers alike. During the course of refactoring we took one large class and split it to multiple classes and interfaces. 
## Six modules
Overall we ended up with six modules and Main as a class unto itself. Below we will post a package diagram demonstrating how the packages interact with each other. Also a special thanks to Plant UML editor for a straightforward clean looking package diagram.
